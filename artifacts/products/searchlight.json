If you are running production workloads in Kubernetes, you probably want to be alerted when things go wrong. Icinga periodically runs various checks on a Kubernetes cluster and sends notifications if detects an issue. It also nicely supplements whitebox monitoring tools like, [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) with blackbox monitoring can catch problems that are otherwise invisible, and also serves as a fallback in case internal systems completely fail. Searchlight is a CRD controller for Kubernetes built around Icinga to address these issues. Searchlight can do the following things for you:\n\n - Periodically run various checks on a Kubernetes cluster and its nodes or pods.\n - Includes a [suite of check commands](/docs/reference/hyperalert/hyperalert.md) written specifically for Kubernetes.\n - Searchlight can send notifications via Email, SMS or Chat.\n - [Supplements](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/alerting/#metamonitoring) the whitebox monitoring tools like [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io).\n\n## Supported Versions\nPlease pick a version of Searchlight that matches your Kubernetes installation.\n\n| Searchlight Version                                                                      | Docs                                                                       | Kubernetes Version |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| [8.0.0](https://github.com/appscode/searchlight/releases/tag/8.0.0) (uses CRD) | [User Guide](https://appscode.com/products/searchlight/8.0.0/welcome/)| 1.9.x+ (test/qa clusters) |\n| [7.0.0](https://github.com/appscode/searchlight/releases/tag/7.0.0) (uses CRD)           | [User Guide](https://appscode.com/products/searchlight/7.0.0/welcome/)     | 1.8.x              |\n| [5.1.1](https://github.com/appscode/searchlight/releases/tag/5.1.1) (uses CRD)           | [User Guide](https://appscode.com/products/searchlight/5.1.1/welcome/)     | 1.7.x+             |\n| [3.0.1](https://github.com/appscode/searchlight/releases/tag/3.0.1) (uses TPR)           | [User Guide](https://github.com/appscode/searchlight/tree/3.0.1/docs)      | 1.5.x - 1.7.x      |\n\n## Installation\nTo install Searchlight, please follow the guide [here](https://appscode.com/products/searchlight/8.0.0/setup/install).\n\n## Using Searchlight\nWant to learn how to use Searchlight?
